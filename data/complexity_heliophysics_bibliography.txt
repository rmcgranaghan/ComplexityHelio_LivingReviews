    abstract = {The linear prediction filters computed by Bargatze et al. [1985] have resulted in a turning point in the study of solar wind-magnetosphere coupling. The evolution of the filters with varying activity provides a clear demonstration that the coupling is nonlinear. The filters have thus brought about the end of one era of linear correlative studies and the beginning of a new era of nonlinear dynamical studies. Two separate, but complementary, approaches have emerged in these dynamical studies, analogue modeling and data-based phase space reconstruction. The reconstruction research has evolved from the original autonomous method studies, which were not conclusive, to the more recent input-output studies that are more appropriate for the solar wind-driven magnetosphere and have produced more reliable results. At present it appears that the modeling and reconstruction approaches may be merged in future attempts to produce analogue models directly from the results of the input-output data-based methods. If this can be accomplished, it will constitute a major step forward toward the goal of a low-dimensional analogue model of the magnetospheric dynamics derived directly from data and interpreted in terms of magnetospheric physics. These developments are reviewed in three sections: autonomous data analysis methods, analogue models, and input-output data analysis methods. The introduction provides sufficient information to read each of these sections independently.},

abstract = {The temporal relationship between the solar wind and magnetospheric activity has been studied using 34 intervals of high time resolution IMP 8 solar wind data and the corresponding AL auroral activity index. The median values of the AL index for each interval were utilized to rank the intervals according to geomagnetic activity level. The linear prediction filtering technique was then applied to model magnetospheric response as measured by the AL index to the solar wind input function VBs. The linear prediction filtering routine produces a filter of time-lagged response coefficients which estimates the most general linear relationship between the chosen input and output parameters of the magnetospheric system. It is found that the filters are composed of two response pulses speaking at time lags of 20 and 60 min. The amplitude of the 60-min pulse is the larger for moderate activity levels, while the 20-min pulse is the larger for strong activity levels. A possible interpretation is that the 20-min pulse represents magnetospheric activity driven directly by solar wind coupling and that the 60-min pulse represents magnetospheric activity driven by the release of energy previously stored in the magnetotail. If this interpretation is correct, the linear filtering results suggest that both the driven and the unloading models of magnetospheric response are inportant facets of a more comprehensive response model.},

abstract = {Abstract We explore the characteristics, controlling parameters, and relationships of multiscale field-aligned currents (FACs) using a rigorous, comprehensive, and cross-platform analysis. Our unique approach combines FAC data from the Swarm satellites and the Advanced Magnetosphere and Planetary Electrodynamics Response Experiment (AMPERE) to create a database of small-scale (∼10–150 km, <1° latitudinal width), mesoscale (∼150–250 km, 1–2° latitudinal width), and large-scale (>250 km) FACs. We examine these data for the repeatable behavior of FACs across scales (i.e., the characteristics), the dependence on the interplanetary magnetic field orientation, and the degree to which each scale “departs” from nominal large-scale specification. We retrieve new information by utilizing magnetic latitude and local time dependence, correlation analyses, and quantification of the departure of smaller from larger scales. We find that (1) FACs characteristics and dependence on controlling parameters do not map between scales in a straight forward manner, (2) relationships between FAC scales exhibit local time dependence, and (3) the dayside high-latitude region is characterized by remarkably distinct FAC behavior when analyzed at different scales, and the locations of distinction correspond to “anomalous” ionosphere-thermosphere behavior. Comparing with nominal large-scale FACs, we find that differences are characterized by a horseshoe shape, maximizing across dayside local times, and that difference magnitudes increase when smaller-scale observed FACs are considered. We suggest that both new physics and increased resolution of models are required to address the multiscale complexities. We include a summary table of our findings to provide a quick reference for differences between multiscale FACs.},

We examine several network measures to quantify the spatiotemporal correlation patterns in the TEC data for winter and summer months in 2016. We find that significant structure exists in the correlation patterns, distinguishing the dayside and nightside ionosphere, and specific features in the high latitudes such as the polar cap and auroral oval, including the cusp and ionospheric foot points of magnetospheric boundary layers. These features vary with the IMF, exhibiting a strong dependence on the north-south direction and generally larger variations during the winter months in both hemispheres. Our exploratory results suggest that network analysis of TEC data can be used to study characteristic ionospheric spatial scales at high latitudes, thereby extending the utility of these data. We explore mesoscale and large scale (greater than tens of kilometers and greater than hundreds of kilometers, respectively) as a function of winter/summer season, hemisphere, and IMF direction and conclude that the relative importance of different ionospheric scales is not a constant relationship. Together with an identification of important areas of future work, our findings provide a foundation for the application of network analysis techniques to ionospheric TEC. Our results suggest that network analysis can reveal new physical connections in the ionospheric system.},

abstract = {Abstract The overall morphology and dynamics of magnetospheric substorms is well established in terms of the observed qualitative auroral features seen in ground-based magnetometers. This paper focuses on the quantitative characterization of substorm dynamics captured by ground-based magnetometer stations. We present the first analysis of substorms using dynamical networks obtained from the full available set of ground-based magnetometer observations in the Northern Hemisphere. The stations are connected in the network when the correlation between the vector magnetometer time series from pairs of stations within a running time window exceeds a threshold. Dimensionless parameters can then be obtained that characterize the network and by extension, the spatiotemporal dynamics of the substorm under observation. We analyze four isolated substorm test cases as well as a steady magnetic convection (SMC) event and a day in which no substorms occur. These test case substorms are found to give a consistent characteristic network response at onset in terms of their spatial correlation. Such responses are differentiable from responses to the SMC event and nonsubstorm times. We present a method to optimize network parametrization with respect to the different individual station responses, the spatial inhomogeneity of stations in the Northern Hemisphere, and the choice of correlation window sizes. Our results suggest that dynamical network analysis has potential to quantitatively categorize substorms.},

We use a dynamically evolving distribution of high-resolution electromagnetic fields from the Lyon-Fedder-Mobarry global MHD model and trace large ensembles of 100 keV hydrogen and oxygen ions as well as electrons from a near-Earth plasma sheet location through their escape from the magnetosphere. In agreement with recent MMS observations, we demonstrate that both ions and electrons have access to and escape throughout the dayside magnetopause, including magnetically drift-shadowed regions. Also, in agreement with MMS observations, the depth of penetration and persistence of particles in the magnetosheath has a clear mass dependence, heavier particles penetrating further and lingering longer. We demonstrate both magnetic local time and latitude dependence of particles losses as manifested by their crossings of the open-closed boundary and relate them to the complex field topology. Finally, we establish a significant role of Kelvin-Helmholtz instability in facilitating particle losses at the magnetopause flanks.},

This chapter explains why it is essential to conduct all economic analysis within a complex (adaptive) systems framework and to show why this makes a very significant difference. It is explained what the original purpose of constrained optimization analysis was when it was imported into economics over a century ago and why what was a sensible and pragmatic application of logic in special circumstances became a general approach to dealing with economic phenomena. Discussion argued that acknowledgement that economic systems are both complex and adaptive means that one has to begin by viewing them as network structures of elements and connections that are, at base, energetically-driven and, thus, dissipative in nature. As such, they are subject to the laws of thermodynamics and survive and grow only if energy throughput can be increased. However, with economic systems, one has to travel well beyond Ilya Prigogine's seminal representation of a complex physiochemical system as a free energy processor and even beyond Daniel Brooks and Edward Wiley's controversial, but very insightful, representation of biological systems as self-organizing information processors, relying on a store of knowledge acquired from experience. Sophisticated economic systems are different because they actively seek new knowledge that is artificially constructed in the human imagination and is not just a by-product of experience.}

It was founded by Claude Shannon toward the middle of the twentieth century and has since then evolved into a vigorous branch of mathematics fostering the development of other scientific fields, such as statistics, biology, behavioral science, neuroscience, and statistical mechanics. The techniques used in information theory are probabilistic in nature and some view information theory as a branch of probability theory. In a given set of possible events, the information of a message describing one of these events quantifies the symbols needed to encode the event in an optimal way. ‘Optimal’ means that the obtained code word will determine the event unambiguously, isolating it from all others in the set, and will have minimal length, that is, it will consist of a minimal number of symbols. Information theory also provides methodologies to separate real information from noise and to determine the channel capacity required for optimal transmission conditioned on the transmission rate.}

abstract = {Abstract The numerous recent breakthroughs in machine learning make imperative to carefully ponder how the scientific community can benefit from a technology that, although not necessarily new, is today living its golden age. This Grand Challenge review paper is focused on the present and future role of machine learning in Space Weather. The purpose is twofold. On one hand, we will discuss previous works that use machine learning for Space Weather forecasting, focusing in particular on the few areas that have seen most activity: the forecasting of geomagnetic indices, of relativistic electrons at geosynchronous orbits, of solar flares occurrence, of coronal mass ejection propagation time, and of solar wind speed. On the other hand, this paper serves as a gentle introduction to the field of machine learning tailored to the Space Weather community and as a pointer to a number of open challenges that we believe the community should undertake in the next decade. The recurring themes throughout the review are the need to shift our forecasting paradigm to a probabilistic approach focused on the reliable assessment of uncertainties, and the combination of physics-based and machine learning approaches, known as gray box.},

abstract = {This paper attempts to synthesize the diverse number of observations of electric fields and currents in the high-latitude ionosphere during substorms. By demonstrating that there are often spatial shifts among regions of high ionospheric conductivity, large electric fields and intense currents in the auroral electrojet, it is shown that substorm time variations of the current patterns over the entire polar region consist of two basic components. The first is related to the two-cell convection pattern and the second to the westward electrojet in the dark sector, which is in turn related to the three-dimensional wedge current system. These two components result from the relative strength of electric fields and conductivities in the intensification of the auroral electrojet and are identified as the signatures for directly driven and the unloading components in solar wind-magnetosphere interactions. We contend that disturbed intervals do not necessitate the presence of substorm expansion-phase activity and that the vast number of earlier complex results concerning the auroral electrojet can be ascertained from the high degree of variability of the two components, depending on substorm events, substorm phases, and their own spatial/temporal scale sizes. It is demonstrated that several major issues that have remained controversial are now accounted for reasonably well in terms of this two-component electrojet model. We also predict specific features of the substorm auroral electrojet that have not yet been observed.},

abstract = {A typical time sequence of AE shows no obvious regularities which suggests either that the magnetosphere is a random (stochastic) system or displays deterministic chaos. To find out whether the magnetosphere is random or chaotic, AE data have been studied by the embedding dimension method to find the correlation dimension of the magnetosphere. The autocorrelation (AC) time scale τ[AC(τ) = ½ AC(0)] is about 50 minutes for all the cases we have investigated. This time scale may represent the time over which the magnetosphere adjusts to sudden changes. The frequency spectrum of the AE data is broadband with a universal form P(ω) ∼ ω−β, where β is about 2 for the frequencies, f = ω/2π between 0.04 mHz and 4 mHz. The correlation dimension for the AE data using a 1 minute delay to construct a time series of m dimensional vectors is between 3 and 4. With the proper time delay τ ⋍ 50min, which is the autocorrelation time, the correlation dimension is around 2.4. The variation of the correlation dimension with different time delays is shown. But because colored noise with β = 2 has a correlation dimension near 2.1, it is not yet possible to determine whether AE index is a signal resulting from colored noise or from deterministic chaos.},

Further, it is shown that  within a factor of 2 for each storm period.A large increase of u(t) is associated with substorm activity. Thus, the energy flux ∈(t) entering the magnetosphere is dissipated through magneto-spheric substorm processes within the magnetosphere, and their accumulated effects can be understood as geomagnetic storm phenomena.}",

It is shown that the magnetosphere-ionosphere coupling system responds somewhat differently to three different input energy flux levels of ε. As ε increases from < 1017 erg s−1 to > 019 erg s−1, typical responses of the magnetosphere-ionosphere coupling system are: ε < 1017 erg s−1: an enhancement of the Sqp, etc, ε ≈ 1018 erg s−1: substorm onset, 1018 erg s−1 < ε < 1019 erg s−1f: a typical substorm, ε >1019 erg s−1: an abnormal growth of the ring current belt, resulting in a magnetospheric storm. It is stressed that the magnetospheric substorm results as a direct response of the magnetosphere to a rise and fall of ε above ≈ 1018 erg s−1, so that it is not caused by a sudden conversion of magnetic energy accumulated prior to substorm onset. The variety of the development of the main phase of geomagnetic storms is also primarily controlled by ε.}

abstract = {The area of the polar cap, i.e. the region of open magnetic field lines or, more practically, the region inside the auroral-oval auroral distribution can be a good indicator of the amount of energy in the magnetotail available for magnetospheric substorms. It is shown that the polar cap is not a simple circle during the episodic development of substorms but expands and contracts non-uniformly, depending strongly upon magnetic local time. Variations of the polar cap area under such circumstances represent merely the average around the oval of different time changes in the polar cap boundary location at different local times, in response to solar wind conditions and the substorm phases. It is demonstrated that this non-uniform expansion/contraction of the polar cap can be accounted for in terms of the relative strength of the two constituents of the solar wind-magnetosphere coupling: the directly-driven and unloading processes.}

abstract = {We demonstrate the existence of a sharp break in the power spectrum of AE at ∼ 5 hours. At frequencies below the break, AE has a ∼ f−1.0 dependence, and at higher frequencies it has a f−2.2 to f−2.4 dependence. The power spectrum of the IMF Bs for the same time interval has a ∼ f−1.4 dependence with no spectral breaks or peaks. Thus, at frequencies above the break, the power in AE varies as f−0.5 to f−0.8 times the power in Bs and at low frequencies it ranges from being f0 (frequency independent) to a f+0.4 times the power in Bs. Several possible explanations of the nonlinear response of AE to the IMF Bs driver are briefly discussed, including: 1) variable ionospheric conductivity (increasing with Bs) for the high frequency regime, and 2) several AE saturation mechanisms for the low frequency regime.},

As they become increasingly subsumed into systems analysis and machine-learning studies of the magnetosphere, it is timely to establish best practice in their derivation and study their limitations. This paper reports on a number of studies carried out to establish some key points. Particular attention is paid to the best metric used to evaluate their performance and how it depends on the application for which the coupling function is intended.},

abstract = {We investigated whether one or a few coupling functions can represent best the interaction between the solar wind and the magnetosphere over a wide variety of magnetospheric activity. Ten variables which characterize the state of the magnetosphere were studied. Five indices from ground-based magnetometers were selected, namely Dst, Kp, AE, AU, and AL, and five from other sources, namely auroral power (Polar UVI), cusp latitude (sin(Λc)), b2i (both DMSP), geosynchronous magnetic inclination angle (GOES), and polar cap size (SuperDARN). These indices were correlated with more than 20 candidate solar wind coupling functions. One function, representing the rate magnetic flux is opened at the magnetopause, correlated best with 9 out of 10 indices of magnetospheric activity. This is dΦMP/dt = v4/3BT2/3sin8/3(θc/2), calculated from (rate IMF field lines approach the magnetopause, ∼v)(\% of IMF lines which merge, sin8/3(θc/2))(interplanetary field magnitude, BT)(merging line length, ∼(BMP/BT)1/3). The merging line length is based on flux matching between the solar wind and a dipole field and agrees with a superposed IMF on a vacuum dipole. The IMF clock angle dependence matches the merging rate reported (albeit with limited statistics) at high altitude. The nonlinearities of the magnetospheric response to BT and v are evident when the mean values of indices are plotted, in scatterplots, and in the superior correlations from dΦMP/dt. Our results show that a wide variety of magnetospheric phenomena can be predicted with reasonable accuracy (r > 0.80 in several cases) ab initio, that is without the time history of the target index, by a single function, estimating the dayside merging rate. Across all state variables studied (including AL, which is hard to predict, and polar cap size, which is hard to measure), dΦMP/dt accounts for about 57.2\% of the variance, compared to 50.9\% for EKL and 48.8\% for vBs. All data sets included at least thousands of points over many years, up to two solar cycles, with just two parameter fits, and the correlations are thus robust. The sole index which does not correlate best with dΦMP/dt is Dst, which correlates best (r = 0.87) with p1/2dΦMP/dt. If dΦMP/dt were credited with this success, its average score would be even higher.},

abstract = {In a 2008 publication a first principles calculation of the dayside reconnection rate expressed in terms of upstream–solar wind parameters led to a rudimentary solar wind coupling function R1 for the Earth's magnetosphere. Four improvements to that derivation are added in the present paper, resulting in a more correct solar wind control function describing the rate at which solar wind magnetic field lines connect into the Earth's magnetosphere. The first is the inclusion of the effect of β-dependent plasma compressibility on the reconnection rate. The second is a corrected calculation of the inflow of magnetic field lines into the reconnection X-line. The third is a more accurate estimate of the orientation of the reconnection X-line for asymmetric reconnection. The fourth correction accounts for the compression ratio of the Earth's bow shock for arbitrary orientation of the solar wind magnetic field. Two solar wind control functions result: one function, R2CS, is based on the Cassak-Shay equation and another function, R2CSB, is based on the Cassak-Shay-Birn equation. The control functions are tested using solar wind measurements and geomagnetic indices from 1980 to 2012, and some improved correlation coefficients over the rudimentary function R1 are found. Simplified approximations to the new control functions are supplied: one is R2CS-approx = 1.68 × 10−2 sin2(θ/2)no1/2vo2MA−0.3044exp(−[MA/3.18]1/2), where the subscript “o” denotes the solar wind upstream of the bow shock and MA is the solar wind Alfvén Mach number.},

abstract = {Abstract We define a coupling function as a product of solar wind factors that partially linearizes the relation between it and a magnetic index. We consider functions that are a product of factors of solar wind speed V, density N, transverse magnetic field B⊥, and interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) clock angle θc each raised to a different power. The index is the auroral lower (AL index) which monitors the strength of the westward electrojet. Solar wind data 1995–2014 provide hour averages of the factors needed to calculate optimum exponents. Nonlinear inversion determines both the exponents and linear prediction filters of short data segments. The averages of all exponents are taken as optimum exponents and for V, N, B⊥, and sin(θc/2) are [1.92, 0.10, 0.79, 3.67] with errors in the second decimal. Hourly values from 1966 to 2014 are used next to calculate the optimum function (opn) and the functions VBs (eys), epsilon (eps), and universal coupling function (ucf). A yearlong window is advanced by 27 days calculating linear prediction filters for the four functions. The functions eps, eys, ucf, and opn, respectively, predict 43.7, 61.2, 65.6, and 68.3\% of AL variance. The opn function is 2.74\% better than ucf with a confidence interval 2.60–2.86\%. Coupling strength defined as the sum of filter weights (nT/mV/m) is virtually identical for all functions and varies systematically with the solar cycle being strongest (188 nT/mV/m) at solar minimum and weakest (104) at solar maximum. Saturation of the polar cap potential approaching solar maximum may explain the variation.},

abstract = {Ultraviolet auroral images from the Ultraviolet Imager (UVI) onboard the POLAR satellite can be used as quantitative remote diagnostics of the auroral regions, yielding estimates of incident energy characteristics, compositional changes, and other higher order data products. Here incident energy estimates derived from UVI are compared with in situ measurements of the same parameters from an overflight by the DMSP F12 satellite coincident with the UVI image times during substorm activity occurring on May 19, 1996. This event was simultaneously observed by WIND, GEOTAIL, INTERBALL, DMSP and NOAA spacecraft as well as by POLAR.},

abstract = {A current disruption (CD) event was observed by the Geotail spacecraft at (X, Y)GSM=(−10.0, 1.9) RE within 1 min from the onset of a substorm. The event was selected as one of four near-Earth current disruption events identified in a search of three years of Geotail data. Fast ion flows accompanied the magnetic field dipolarization, rendering this event a near-Earth bursty bulk flow (BBF) event. The gradient anisotropy of the 30–44 keV ions at the onset of the flow is consistent with an Earthward motion of the heated plasma and agrees with the direction of flux and energy transport. The aurora and the associated electrojet moved from low to high latitudes during substorm expansion. Our observations show that CDs and BBFs are qualitatively similar phenomena in the near-Earth tail, both associated with poleward-moving (classical) auroral substorms.},

LDA is a three-level hierarchical Bayesian model, in which each item of a collection is modeled as a finite mixture over an underlying set of topics. Each topic is, in turn, modeled as an infinite mixture over an underlying set of topic probabilities. In the context of text modeling, the topic probabilities provide an explicit representation of a document. We present efficient approximate inference techniques based on variational methods and an EM algorithm for empirical Bayes parameter estimation. We report results in document modeling, text classification, and collaborative filtering, comparing to a mixture of unigrams model and the probabilistic LSI model.},

abstract = {Coupled biological and chemical systems, neural networks, social interacting species, the Internet and the World Wide Web, are only a few examples of systems composed by a large number of highly interconnected dynamical units. The first approach to capture the global properties of such systems is to model them as graphs whose nodes represent the dynamical units, and whose links stand for the interactions between them. On the one hand, scientists have to cope with structural issues, such as characterizing the topology of a complex wiring architecture, revealing the unifying principles that are at the basis of real networks, and developing models to mimic the growth of a network and reproduce its structural properties. On the other hand, many relevant questions arise when studying complex networks’ dynamics, such as learning how a large ensemble of dynamical systems that interact through a complex wiring topology can behave collectively. We review the major concepts and results recently achieved in the study of the structure and dynamics of complex networks, and summarize the relevant applications of these ideas in many different disciplines, ranging from nonlinear science to biology, from statistical mechanics to medicine and engineering.}

We construct dynamical directed networks from this data for the first time. If the canonical cross-correlation between vector magnetic field perturbations observed at two magnetometer stations exceeds a threshold, they form a network connection. The time lag at which canonical cross-correlation is maximal determines the direction of propagation or expansion of the structure captured by the network connection. If spatial correlation reflects ionospheric current patterns, network properties can test different models for the evolving substorm current system. We select 86 isolated substorms based on nightside ground station coverage. We find, and obtain the timings for, a consistent picture in which the classic substorm current wedge forms. A current system is seen premidnight following the substorm current wedge westward expansion. Later, there is a weaker signal of eastward expansion. Finally, there is evidence of substorm-enhanced convection.},

abstract = {Abstract Magnetospheric substorms represent key explosive processes in the interaction of the Earth's magnetosphere with the solar wind, and their understanding and modeling are critical for space weather forecasting. During substorms, the magnetic field on the nightside is first stretched in the antisunward direction and then it rapidly contracts earthward bringing hot plasmas from the distant space regions into the inner magnetosphere, where they contribute to geomagnetic storms and Joule dissipation in the polar ionosphere, causing impressive splashes of aurora. Here we show for the first time that mining millions of spaceborne magnetometer data records from multiple missions allows one to reconstruct the global 3-D picture of these stretching and dipolarization processes. Stretching results in the formation of a thin (less than the Earth's radius) and strong current sheet, which is diverted into the ionosphere during dipolarization. In the meantime, the dipolarization signal propagates further into the inner magnetosphere resulting in the accumulation of a longer lived current there, giving rise to a protogeomagnetic storm. The global 3-D structure of the corresponding substorm currents including the substorm current wedge is reconstructed from data.},

abstract = {This chapter reviews the stability analysis based on the conventional Gibbs approach considering the stability of equilibrium, near equilibrium, and far from equilibrium states with some case studies. The entropy production approach for nonequilibrium systems appears to be more general for stability analysis. One major implication of the nonequilibrium thermodynamics theory is the introduction of the distance from global equilibrium as a constraint for determining the stability of nonequilibrium systems. When a system is far from global equilibrium, the possibility of new organized structures of matter arise beyond an instability point. Nonequilibrium conditions may occur with respect to disturbances in the interior of a system, or between a system and its surroundings. As a result, the local stress, strain, temperature, concentration, and energy density may vary at each instance in time. This may lead to instability in space and time. Constantly changing properties cannot be described properly by referring to the system. Some averaging of the properties in space and time is necessary. Such averages need to be clearly stated in the utilization and correlation of experimental data, especially when their interpretations are associated with theories that are valid at equilibrium.}

Here I propose that we can gain traction on downward causation by being operational and examining how adaptive systems identify regularities in evolutionary or learning time and use these regularities to guide behaviour. I suggest that in many adaptive systems components collectively compute their macroscopic worlds through coarse-graining. I further suggest we move from simple feedback to downward causation when components tune behaviour in response to estimates of collectively computed macroscopic properties. I introduce a weak and strong notion of downward causation and discuss the role the strong form plays in the origins of new organizational levels. I illustrate these points with examples from the study of biological and social systems and deep neural networks. This article is part of the themed issue ‘Reconceptualizing the origins of life’. }

ABSTRACT = {In the polar ionosphere, the electric field is characterized by broadband and power law spectral densities at small/short spatio-temporal scales, which support a possible turbulent nature of the electric field fluctuations. Here, we investigate the multifractal character of the full three-dimensional electric field in the polar ionosphere as recorded on board the first Chinese Seismo-Electromagnetic Satellite (CSES-01). The results of our analysis prove a clear different degree of multifractality of the electric field fluctuations approaching either the polar cap trailing edge or the auroral region. The observed differences in the multifractal character are interpreted in terms of the different natures of the particle precipitation in the polar cap and in the auroral region. A possible link between the multifractal nature of electric field fluctuations, parallel to the geomagnetic field, and filamentation of field aligned currents (FACs) is established.},

abstract = {Summary This chapter reviews recent findings of multi-scale structures and dynamics in the high-latitude ionosphere, particularly on meso-scale (10s-100s km) processes, as well as their roles in cross-regional interaction processes. Localized and transient structures often occur at the cusp, polar cap, and auroral oval, and their magnitudes can be comparable or larger than those of large-scale background. However, their properties and coupling are not well understood, and specification of their structures and variabilities are critical for numerical modeling. The meso-scale covers a myriad processes and phenomena, including poleward-moving auroral forms (PMAFs), polar cap patches, auroral arcs, poleward boundary intensifications (PBIs), streamers, substorm, surges, diffuse aurora, and related flow channels, field-aligned currents (FACs) and precipitation/conductance. Small-scale features also play important roles in the creation and behavior in multi-scale dynamics. While those structures are localized, they have net effects on large-scale dynamics, and can influence surrounding regions by propagating over long distances. An approach to quantify meso-scale precipitation contributions using the THEMIS all-sky imagers is presented, and we show that meso-scale precipitation has a substantial (25-50\%) contribution, indicating critical importance of multi-scale processes for understanding Geospace processes. The current state and necessity of specification for advancing understanding of multi-scale coupling processes are discussed.}

In contrast to most other meetings, people were specifically asked not to present and discuss their recent results. Rather, they were asked to bring their opinions and thoughts on unsolved problems to the meeting. Short presentations were encouraged after which the audience would debate and discuss definitions of the problems and how they could be overcome. Were new observations required? New missions? Or simply did the community need to work better together to resolve pertinent and outstanding science questions? Around 50\% of the meeting schedule was devoted to discussion sessions on these topics.},

abstract = {The scientific ascent of humankind comes in two forms: incremental progress with traditional thinking, and paradigm transition. The latter typically engenders intense debate, often long lasting, before the transition of the paradigm is deemed acceptable. The magnetospheric discipline is no exception, especially in view of the sparse observations available to reach conclusive theory-data closure. Scientific controversies serve an important role in identifying significant unresolved issues for progress to be made. This review highlights key issues on four controversies present in magnetospheric physics: (1) the on-and-off debate on whether the magnetic field combined with the plasma bulk flow or the electric field combined with the current density is the primary quantity in treating magnetospheric problems; (2) the proper interpretation of transient dayside magnetospheric phenomena, i.e., whether they are related to flux transfer events, plasma transfer events, or solar wind pressure pulses; (3) the physical processes responsible for substorm onset; and (4) justifications for substorms or enhanced magnetospheric convection as the cause of magnetic storms. In issue 1 the merits and limitations of the two approaches are expounded. In issue 2 the predicted similarities and differences between the three interpretations are summarized. In issue 3 the strengths and weaknesses of prominent existing substorm models are elaborated on. In issue 4 the two contributors to storms are recognized and combined. Each controversy has an element of a paradigm transition. The resolutions of these controversies appear to also have one common element in that the presumption of only one theory to be correct may not be valid; a synthesis of existing theories may provide a better understanding of all features associated with the phenomenon.},

The Semantic Web has proven invaluable in this effort; however, much of the literature is devoted to system design, ontology creation, and trials and tribulations of current technologies. In order to fully develop the nascent field of Semantic e-Science we must also evaluate systems in real-world settings. We describe a case study within the field of Heliophysics and provide a comparison of the evolutionary stages of data discovery, from manual to semantically enable. We describe the socio-technical implications of moving toward automated and intelligent data discovery. In doing so, we highlight how this process enhances what is currently being done manually in various scientific disciplines. Our case study illustrates that Semantic e-Science is more than just semantic search. The integration of search with web services, relational databases, and other cyberinfrastructure is a central tenet of our case study and one that we believe has applicability as a generalized research area within Semantic e-Science. This case study illustrates a specific example of the benefits, and limitations, of semantically replicating data discovery. We show examples of significant reductions in time and effort enable by Semantic e-Science; yet, we argue that a “complete” solution requires integrating semantic search with other research areas such as data provenance and web services.}

abstract = {In this paper we examine the claim that the power law distribution of burst lifetimes in the AE index is evidence that the magnetosphere is a Self-Organized Critical (SOC) system. To do this we compare the burst lifetime distributions of the AU and |AL| indices with those of the υBs and ε solar wind input functions. We show for the first time that both the υBs and ε burst lifetime distributions are of power law form with an exponential cut-off, consistent with the solar wind being an SOC system. Furthermore, the power law of the ε burst lifetime distribution is not significantly different to that of the AU and |AL| indices, indicating that this scale-free property of the AE indices could arise from the solar wind input and may not be an intrinsic property of the magnetospheric system. We discuss the implications of this result for SOC theories of the magnetosphere.},

pages="1--15",
abstract="A clear terminology is essential in every research discipline. In the context of ESOA, a lot of confusion exists about the meaning of the terms emergence and self-organisation. One of the sources of the confusion comes from the fact that a combination of both phenomena often occurs in dynamical systems. In this paper a historic overview of the use of each concept as well as a working definition, that is compatible with the historic and current meaning of the concepts, is given. Each definition is explained by supporting it with important characteristics found in the literature. We show that emergence and self-organisation each emphasise different properties of a system. Both phenomena can exist in isolation. The paper also outlines some examples of such systems and considers the combination of emergence and self-organisation as a promising approach in complex multi-agent systems.",
